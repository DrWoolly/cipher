# cipher
This is a cheap message cipher tool that takes a text input from the and runs it through a ceaser cipher and exports it to an output.txt file. 

Any new encoding/decoding will overwrite the output.txt file.

The seed works with a interger of any length.

Including ":" and an integer at the end of the seed will run the encoded/decoded text through the cipher by multiple times as defined integer placed after the ":"
